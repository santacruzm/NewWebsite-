#### I am a Service Leader

_Alternative Spring Break Trip_ is an extracurricular service activity I have volunteer my time to consecutively. _Reading Partners organization,_ a child literacy program that provides individualized reading support to improve at grade level, in which I volunteered for a week and a half as I drove to Washington DC in efforts to make a change in the lives of children. Every morning I would get up early to commute to Malcolm X elementary school where I was fortunate to meet various kids. I was sensitive to the realities of injustice in the community and self-aware in understanding the depth of my capacity to bring change to the children I was working with. Most of them were coming in from tough walks of life in which they lived in poverty and were not sure where the next meal would come from. I resonated with this asset of their lives, as my parents had similar experiences. I remember clearly teaching the same reading lesson to a fourth grader who looks at me mid-sentence and says, “thanks for being here, but I can’t focus. Because the moment that I walk out this room these kids will make fun of my ripped shoes.” I proceeded to share my story growing up in a low-income, in a nutshell, hoping to give the student realist encouragement.

As an open-minded person, I participated in the service trip because I wanted to share a part of myself if that meant it would bring hope to others while simultaneously being cognizant to work alongside others rather than looking through a tourist lens.  As I taught daily English lessons, I have achieved a basic understanding: no matter where I am, I have something to learn from everyone and everything. Observing these kids from all ethnic groups, I learned that understanding difference is a vital key component to lifelong success since in the workforce as you will be made to work with others that carry a different lens of viewing life. Therefore, I was able to identify with a variety of individuals and situation despite the external differences in culture and social norms all of course through service. I strive to be a voice and not an echo. I embraced the environment by actively listening, being mindful and considerate of the children. Ultimately, I experienced narratives and stories first hand in their unique cultural environments which shaped the way I thought about life.

Clearly, I remember a specific student who I had been working with day after day ask me to make the effort to go watch her cheerleading skills during practice which consequently was at the same time of my departure. With persistence, I showcased the vitalness of small gestures and convinced the group to push departure time back. Clapping and cheering at her cheerleading practice, the student who was a stranger a couple of weeks ago ran to me with a hug of appreciation. It was at that moment that I truly knew it is the little things that can change the world for a person. The simple fact of knowing that someone cares and believes in you is a powerful lesson I gained. The participation of the Service Trip allowed me to promote the widest influence for good as I go back to Allegheny and my hometown community sharing on my personal stories on my service experience. With the high hopes of encouraging and informing students about the vitalness of part taking in service trips toward the cultivation of a better self. Instead of vacationing during spring break I have dedicated myself to the civic engagement work on my path to spread the wildest influence of good.
