# Web Project - Closing Remarks

####Building Process 
During the site building process, one of the major challenges for me was summarizing myself up in a few words. This challenge was similar to the one during the crafting of my resume. I am not the person to do only one thing. I have numerous experiences in different fields. I learned my lesson in the resume formulation process, instead of having a 3 page resume which is overwhelming and doing too much, I decided to omit information that was out dates. Same logic was implemented when formulating this site, instead of having 20 heavy worded bullet points I decided to write a concise paragraph demonstrating what I do. The essayist approach really speak to my focus in media studies and major in Communication Arts. In the sense that it provides a glimpse into my passion for storytelling.  

####Audience 
The overall audience for my site consists of employers, recruiters, fellowship programs, and all who wants to discover my focus and journey. Every aspect of my site plays a vital role in capturing the attention of skills and abilities. This is primarily done for the purpose of showing my confidence in my brand that is myself. My hope here is to get my story out to the audience as effective as possible. At the same time, I was hoping to not talk a lot of space but still keep it within the realms of concise and memorable. 

####Design 
My website design is simplistic, but also professional. In order to make a great first impression with my audience, I focused my site to be visually appealing to the viewer. To generate traffic on my site, I took into consideration various different page titles and descriptions in an effort to implement those keywords that are search engine friendly. The structure of my site is listed in chronological order because I want to focus the attention of the reader on relevant material. Overall, my website structure serves as an advertisement for myself.
